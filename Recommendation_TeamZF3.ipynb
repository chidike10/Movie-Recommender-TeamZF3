    "It is almost impossible for a person to attempt to consume all the products and choices available. It is even most likely that a person will not have the time, patience or resources to even view the myraids of choices in terms of products and services available at his disposal. Hence, it becomes almost imperative for producers of goods and services to help narrow down the choices of products presented to their users in an attempt to reduce overwhelming them and help them reach thier relevant products and services without waste of time and as a result, helping them have a better user experience, while also exposing them to more products and services they might have never discovered otherwise. This help comes in the form of  <b> recommendation </b>\n",

    "Simple as the above sounds, it is not as easy to implement because the traditional approach would have been to deploy product recommender agents (like customer service representatives) who will handle recommendation requests from customers. But these agents will be unable to learn about every of thier customers and what products and services they might want and find useful. So how does one recommend products and services to people he does not know?\n",

    "The response is using Recommender Systems. Recommender systems are machine learning systems that help users discover products and services based on the relationship between the users and the products.Recommender systems are like salesmen who have learnt to recognize customers and the products they might like based on their history and preferences. Recommender systems are so common place now that every time you shop online, a  recommendation system is guiding you towards the most likely product you might purchase.\n",

Primarily, EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.This approach for data analysis uses many tools(mainly graphical to maximize insight into a data set, extract important variables, detect outliers and anomalies, amongst other details that is missed when looking at DataFrame. This step is very important especially when we model the data in order to apply Machine Learning techniques."

It is based off the assumption that if a user likes a particular item, other users sharing similar trait with the user will most likely like the item. Hence, if a user rates a particular movie very high, there is a high chance another user who enjoys similar rating patern with the use will rank the movie high. \n",
